📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes customer churn data and builds predictive models to identify customers likely to churn. The aim is to help businesses reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.

📝 Overview

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Power BI to uncover patterns and key churn drivers.

Built and compared multiple classification models using scikit-learn:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Visualization: Power BI
